A callback is a function that you passed as an argument to another function
This allows you to specify code that should run after certain task is completed

Why use callbacks ?

Callbacks are commly used for the tasks that take time to complete,fetching data from an server or waiting for timer to finish.
They help to make sure that some code runs only after another piece of code has finished


Summary
Callbacks are used to handle tasks that take time. They allow us to wait for something to finish before running more code.

In this example, the callback is executed after the timer is done, showing how we can work with asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

By using callbacks, we can manage the flow of our code, ensuring that certain actions only happen after specific tasks are completed!
