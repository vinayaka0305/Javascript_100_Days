View State: 
This usually refers to the UI state of a webpage,like which session is expanded,
which button is clicked, or what text is typed in the form.
It only exists while you're on the page and disappears when you refresh or leave;

Session State:
This is data stored from a user's session, meaning it remains available as long as the user in on the website(even if they navigate to different pages).
Once they close the browser or logout, the session state is lost
It's often stored in cookies,session storage or on the server


key Difference:
View State: Exists only while you are on the page, refreshing = lost

Session State: Stays as long as your session is active(until you close the browser)
