Difference Between JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS)


1.Basic nature
 JS : A programming language
 TS : A superset of js that adds extra features like TypeScript

2.Typing
 JS: Dynamically typed(no type definitions);
 TS: Statically typed (you define variable types)

3.Error
 JS: Catches errors only at run time;
 TS: Catches errors at compile time(before running);

4.Learning Curve:
 JS : Easier for beginners(no need to worry about types)
 TS: Slighlty harder but helps prevent bugs

5.Usage
 JS: Directly runs in the browser
 TS: Needs to be compiled into javascript to run

Conclusion
Use JS for quick and simple projects
Use TS for larger,more complex projects where catching error early is important

// JavaScript
let name = "Alice";  // No type specified
name = 42;           // Allowed


let name: string = "Alice"; // Type is string
name = 42;                  // ‚ùå Error: Type mismatch
