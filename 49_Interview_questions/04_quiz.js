let a = {};               // Initialize an empty object 'a'
let b = { key: "b" };     // Initialize an object 'b' with a property 'key' set to "b"
let c = { key: "c" };     // Initialize an object 'c' with a property 'key' set to "c"

//here we are passed object as key to another object;

a[b] = 123;               // Set a property in 'a' objext with the key 'b' object(converted to a string "[object Object]") to 123

a[c] = 456;               // Set a property in 'a' with the key 'c' (also converted to "[object Object]") to 456, overwriting the previous entry

// console.log(a);{[object Object]: 456}

console.log(a[b]);        // Output the value at 'a[b]', which is now 456 due to the overwritten key


// In JavaScript, objects used as keys are automatically converted to strings, so both b and c become the string "[object Object]". Thus, a[b] and a[c] refer to the same property, causing a[c] = 456 to overwrite the previous assignment of a[b] = 123. Therefore, console.log(a[b]); outputs 456.
