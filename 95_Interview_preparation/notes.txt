Valid Operation in JavaScript:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
numbers[100] = 500;

Assigning a value to an out-of-bounds index in an array is valid in JavaScript. The array will automatically expand to accommodate the new index.

Sparse Array:
The array becomes sparse because there are no values assigned for indices 4 to 99. These indices are considered "empty slots" (or holes).

Output Behavior:
The logged array shows <96 empty items> for the missing indices between 4 and 99.

Key Points to Remember:
Sparse arrays can cause unexpected behavior, especially when iterating over the array, as the "empty slots" are skipped by many array methods like forEach.
Use this feature carefully, as it may lead to bugs or performance issues in large arrays.

Here’s the corrected explanation for `"use strict"` in JavaScript:

---

### **What is `"use strict"`?**

`"use strict"` is a directive in JavaScript that enforces a stricter set of rules for writing code. It helps developers avoid common mistakes and makes the code more secure and easier to debug.

---

### **What Does It Do?**

1. **Prevents Using Undeclared Variables:**
   - Without `"use strict"`, assigning a value to an undeclared variable creates a global variable.
   - With `"use strict"`, it throws an error if a variable is not declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
     ```javascript
     "use strict";
     x = 10; // Error: x is not defined
     ```

2. **Disallows Duplicates in Function Parameters:**
   - Duplicate parameter names are not allowed in strict mode.
     ```javascript
     "use strict";
     function example(a, a) { // Error: Duplicate parameter name not allowed
         return a;
     }
     ```

3. **Restricts `this` in Functions:**
   - In non-strict mode, `this` in a regular function refers to the global object (`window`).
   - In strict mode, `this` is `undefined` if the function is called without a specific context.
     ```javascript
     "use strict";
     function test() {
         console.log(this); // `undefined` instead of `window`
     }
     test();
     ```

4. **Forbids Deleting Variables or Functions:**
   - Strict mode prevents you from deleting variables or functions, which is not allowed anyway.
     ```javascript
     "use strict";
     var a = 10;
     delete a; // Error: Cannot delete a variable
     ```

5. **Prohibits Certain Reserved Words for Future Use:**
   - Words like `implements`, `interface`, and `private` cannot be used as variable or function names.
     ```javascript
     "use strict";
     var private = 10; // Error: Unexpected strict mode reserved word
     ```

---

### **How to Use `"use strict"`?**

1. **At the Beginning of a Script:**
   - Applies strict mode to the entire script.
     ```javascript
     "use strict";
     var x = 10;
     ```

2. **In a Specific Function:**
   - Applies strict mode only to the function where it’s declared.
     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
         "use strict";
         var y = 20; // Strict mode applies here
     }
     ```

---

### **Why Use `"use strict"`?**
- Helps avoid common mistakes like using undeclared variables.
- Makes the code easier to debug.
- Ensures better compatibility with future JavaScript versions.

---

### **In Short:**
- `"use strict"` enforces strict rules for writing clean and secure code.
- It checks for undeclared variables, duplicate parameters, and other common mistakes.
