In javascript, almost everything is an object because
javascript was desingned to make it easy to work with different types of data and interact with them in flexible ways

1.Objects can store different kinds of data:

An object is like a container or a storage box.You can put all kinds of the data init -like numbers,text or even other Objects 
In real life, imagine a backpack where you can put books,snacks,pens, or anything else.In javascript, objects are like these backpacks

2.Objects have properties and methods:

Objects are great because they properties(data they store) and method (things they can do).For example, if you have an object representing car, it might have properties like color,speed and methods like drive() or stop();


3.Easier to Group data together:

By treating almose everything is an object,javascript let you group related data and behaviours together.
For example, if you have a person's data like their name,age and address, you can put it all in one object rather than separate variables. This keeps the code organised
and makes it easy to work with

Uniform Way to interact with data:

When everything is object, you can interact with all data in similar ways.
Whether it is number,text, or complex data, you can use same approach to access or change it.

Examples of JavaScript Objects

Numbers: In JavaScript, even numbers have object-like features. For example, you can use .toFixed() to limit the decimal places of a number:

let num = 5.678;
console.log(num.toFixed(1));  // Output: "5.7"

Strings: Text values in JavaScript (strings) are objects too. You can use properties and methods to work with them, like .length to get the number of characters, or .toUpperCase() to make them uppercase:

let greeting = "hello";
console.log(greeting.toUpperCase());  // Output: "HELLO"


Arrays: Arrays, which hold lists of items, are also objects. They have methods like .push() to add items, or .length to check how many items are in the list:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
console.log(fruits.length);  // Output: 2

In short, by making everything an object, javascript makes it easier to organise data,store related information together and access or manipulate data consistently accross the language.
